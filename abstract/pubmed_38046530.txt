Abstract: Amniotic fluid embolism is an unpredictable and sometimes lethal complication of childbirth. Fibrinogen γ-chain peptide-coated, ADP-encapsulated Liposomes (H12-(ADP)-liposomes), which were developed as a platelet substitute, may be useful to control postpartum hemorrhage with consumptive coagulopathy. This study aimed to establish a hemodynamically stable amniotic fluid embolism animal model and evaluate the efficacy of H12-ADP-liposome infusion in the initial management of postpartum hemorrhage complicated with amniotic fluid embolism-involved coagulopathy. Pregnant New Zealand white rabbits (28th day of pregnancy or normal gestation period of 29-35 days) underwent cesarean delivery, followed by intravenous administration of amniotic fluid (a total of 3.0 mL administered in 4 doses over 9 minutes). Thereafter, uncontrolled postpartum hemorrhage was induced by transecting the right midartery and concomitant vein in the myometrium. After initial bleeding for 5 minutes, rabbits received isovolemic fluid resuscitation through the femoral vein with an equivalent volume of blood loss every 5 minutes for 60 minutes. The transfusion regimens included platelet-rich plasma, platelet-poor plasma, and a bolus administration of H12-ADP-liposomes followed by platelet-poor plasma transfusion (8 rabbits per group). Moreover, 60 minutes after initiation of bleeding, rabbits received surgical hemostasis by ligation of bleeding vessels, except in cases with spontaneous hemostasis. The administration of amniotic fluid caused thrombocytopenia (56±3 × 103/μL) and prolonged both clotting time (before administration: 130.0±3.0 to 171.0±5.0 seconds) and prothrombin time (4.5±0.1 to 4.7±0.1 seconds). After the initial 5-minute bleeding in the rabbits, the mean arterial pressure fell to 43±2 mm Hg. Platelet-poor plasma transfusion alone further prolonged clotting time and prothrombin time at 60 minutes (192.0±10.0 and 5.2±0.1 seconds, respectively) with decreasing mean arterial pressure to <40 mm Hg. By contrast, the administration of H12-ADP-liposomes followed by platelet-poor plasma transfusion reduced the prolonged clotting time (153.0±5.0 seconds) and prothrombin time (4.9±0.1 seconds) similar to platelet-rich plasma transfusion (154.0±11.0 and 4.9±0.1 seconds, respectively) at 60 minutes. These rabbits maintained a mean arterial pressure of >45 mm Hg throughout the experiment. H12-ADP-liposome infusion and platelet-poor plasma transfusion and platelet-rich plasma transfusion yielded spontaneous hemostasis in 4 of 8 rabbits, whereas platelet-poor plasma transfusion did not stop bleeding in any of the rabbits. The total blood loss was 59±17 mL in the H12-ADP-liposomes and platelet-poor plasma group, which was half of that in the platelet-poor plasma group (124±10 mL). H12-ADP-liposome infusion may be effective in the initial management of postpartum hemorrhage complicated with amniotic fluid embolism, resulting in mitigation of consumptive coagulopathy.
