Title: Global knowledge mapping and emerging trends in Helicobacter pylori-related precancerous lesions of gastric cancer research: A bibliometric analysis from 2013 to 2023. 
DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000036445 
Abstract: Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection is a crucial element in chronic gastritis progression towards precancerous lesions of gastric cancer (PLGC) formation and, potentially, gastric cancer; however, screening for and eliminating H pylori has several challenges. This study aimed to assess the present research status, prominent themes, and frontiers of H pylori-related PLGC and to provide impartial evaluations of the developmental trends in this domain. This study extracted articles and review papers concerning H pylori-related PLGC published from 2013 to 2023 from the Web of Science Core Collection. The data was analyzed and visualized using VOSviewer and CiteSpace. The study encompassed 1426 papers, with a discernible upward trend in publications between 2013 and 2023. China emerged as the most productive country, whereas the United States exerted the greatest influence. Baylor College of Medicine was the most prolific institution. World Journal of Gastroenterology featured the highest number of published papers, whereas Gastroenterology was the most frequently cited journal. Kim N. from South Korea was the most prolific author. Co-cited literature pertained to various aspects such as gastritis classification, H pylori infection management, gastric cancer prevention, and managing patients with PLGC. Future research will focus on the Kyoto classification, cancer incidence, and gastric intestinal metaplasia. The results of this study indicate a persistent increase in attention directed toward H pylori-associated PLGC. The research emphasis has transitioned from molecular mechanisms, epidemiology, monitoring, and diagnosis to clinical prevention and treatment methodologies. The forthcoming research direction in this area will concentrate on controlling and preventing malignant PLGC transformation.
