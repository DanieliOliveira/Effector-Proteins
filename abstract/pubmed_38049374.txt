Title: Effects of the combination of Lactobacillus helveticus and isomalto-oligosaccharide on survival, gut microbiota, and immune function in Apis cerana worker bees. 
DOI: 10.1093/lambio/ovad134 
Abstract: The adult worker bees were fed sucrose syrup or sucrose syrup supplemented with Lactobacillus helveticus KM7, prebiotic isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO), or L. helveticus KM7 combined with IMO. Survival rate, gut microbiota and gene expression of gut antimicrobial peptides in worker honey bees were determined. Administration of L. helveticus KM7 and IMO significantly increased the survival rate in worker bees relative to bees fed sucrose only. Then, higher concentration of both lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium in the gut and lower counts of gut fungi, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides-Porphyromonas-Prevotella were observed in bees fed the combination of KM7 and IMO compared with control bees. The combination of L. helveticus KM7 with IMO showed greater or comparable modulating effect on those bacteria relative to either KM7 or IMO alone. Furthermore, the combination treatment of L. helveticus KM7 and IMO enhanced mRNA expression of antimicrobial peptides genes including Abaecin, Defensin, and the gene encoding prophenoloxidase (PPO) in the gut compared with both control bees and those either L. helveticus KM7 or IMO alone. These results suggest that the combination of L. helveticus KM7 and IMO synergistically modifies the gut microbiota and immunity and consequently improves the survival rate of A. cerana adult workers.
