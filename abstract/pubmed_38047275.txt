Title: Study of the binding of ΔFN3.1 fragments of the Bifidobacterium longum GT15 with TNFα and prevalence of domain-containing proteins in groups of bacteria of the human gut microbiota. 
DOI: 10.20517/mrr.2023.06 
Abstract: Aim: This study is mainly devoted to determining the ability of ∆FN3.1 protein fragments of Bifidobacterium (B.) longum subsp. longum GT15, namely two FN3 domains (2D FN3) and a C-terminal domain (CD FN3), to bind to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Methods: Fragments of the fn3 gene encoding the 2D FN3 and CD FN3 were cloned in Escherichia (E.) coli. In order to assess the binding specificity between 2D FN3 and CD FN3 to TNFα, we employed the previously developed sandwich ELISA system to detect any specific interactions between the purified protein and any of the studied cytokines. The trRosetta software was used to build 3D models of the ∆FN3.1, 2D FN3, and CD FN3 proteins. The detection of polymorphism in the amino acid sequences of the studied proteins and the analysis of human gut-derived bacterial proteins carrying FN3 domains were performed in silico. Results: We experimentally showed that neither 2D FN3 nor CD FN3 alone can bind to TNFα. Prediction of the 3D structures of ΔFN3.1, 2D FN3, and CD FN3 suggested that only ΔFN3.1 can form a pocket allowing binding with TNFα to occur. Polymorphism analysis of amino acid sequences of ΔFN3.1 proteins in B. longum strains uncovered substitutions that can alter the conformation of the spatial structure of the ΔFN3.1 protein. We also analyzed human gut-derived bacterial proteins harboring FN3 domains which allowed us to differentiate between those containing motifs of cytokine receptors (MCRs) in their FN3 domains and those lacking them. Conclusion: Only the complete ∆FN3.1 protein can selectively bind to TNFα. Analysis of 3D models of the 2D FN3, CD FN3, and ΔFN3.1 proteins showed that only the ΔFN3.1 protein is potentially capable of forming a pocket allowing TNFα binding to occur. Only FN3 domains containing MCRs exhibited sequence homology with FN3 domains of human proteins.
