Title: Regulation of the cell division hydrolase RipC by the FtsEX system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-43770-6 
Abstract: The FtsEX complex regulates, directly or via a protein mediator depending on bacterial genera, peptidoglycan degradation for cell division. In mycobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria, the FtsEX system directly activates peptidoglycan-hydrolases by a mechanism that remains unclear. Here we report our investigation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsEX as a non-canonical regulator with high basal ATPase activity. The cryo-EM structures of the FtsEX system alone and in complex with RipC, as well as the ATP-activated state, unveil detailed information on the signal transduction mechanism, leading to the activation of RipC. Our findings indicate that RipC is recognized through a "Match and Fit" mechanism, resulting in an asymmetric rearrangement of the extracellular domains of FtsX and a unique inclined binding mode of RipC. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of FtsEX and RipC regulation in the context of a critical human pathogen, guiding the design of drugs targeting peptidoglycan remodeling.
