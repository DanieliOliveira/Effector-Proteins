Title: Functional Roles of N-Terminal Domains in Pullulanase from Human Gut Lactobacillus acidophilus. 
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jafc.3c06487 
Abstract: Pullulanases are multidomain α-glucan debranching enzymes with one or more N-terminal domains (NTDs) including carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and domains of unknown function (DUFs). To elucidate the roles of NTDs in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM pullulanase (LaPul), two truncated variants, Δ41-LaPul (lacking CBM41) and Δ(41+DUFs)-LaPul (lacking CBM41 and two DUFs), were produced recombinantly. LaPul recognized 1.3- and 2.2-fold more enzyme attack-sites on starch granules compared to Δ41-LaPul and Δ(41+DUFs)-LaPul, respectively, as measured by interfacial kinetics. Δ41-LaPul displayed markedly lower affinity for starch granules and β-cyclodextrin (10- and >21-fold, respectively) in comparison to LaPul, showing substrate binding mainly stems from CBM41. Δ(41+DUFs)-LaPul exhibited a 12 °C lower melting temperature than LaPul and Δ41-LaPul, indicating that the DUFs are critical for LaPul stability. Notably, Δ41-LaPul exhibited a 14-fold higher turnover number (kcat) and 9-fold higher Michaelis constant (KM) compared to LaPul, while Δ(41+DUFs)-LaPul's values were close to those of LaPul, possibly due to the exposure of aromatic by truncation.
