Abstract: Bacteriocins are ribosomal-synthesized peptides with antimicrobial activity, produced by different groups of bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Most of the produced by LAB bacteriocins can be described with rather broad spectra of inhibition and they offer suggested applications in food preservation and pharmaceutical sector. Different LAB were isolated from fermented food products and fruits, obtained from the region of Pohang, Korea, and identified based on physiological, biochemical, and molecular methods. The promising isolates, Pediococcus pentosaceus 732, Lactococcus lactis 808, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 431, were identified based on biochemical, physiological, and biomolecular approaches, including 16S rRNA partial sequencing, and were evaluated for production of bacteriocin, including stability in presence of enzymes, chemicals, pH, and temperatures. Adherence properties for the expressed bacteriocins by P. pentosaceus 732, Lc. lactis 808, and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis 431 were evaluated at presence of selected chemicals, pH, and temperatures. The presence of bacteriocin genes in the strains was investigated and analyzed. The bacterial effect of bacteriocin produced by studied strains on Listeria spp. and Staphylococcus spp. has been shown for actively growing and stationary cells. Similar growth and bacteriocin production were observed when studied strains were cultured in MRS at 30 °C or 37 °C. The presence of nisin operon with some point mutations on the genomic DNA was recorded based on the performed PCR reactions targeting different genes associated with nisin expression for both lactococcal strains. Pediocin PA-1 operon was evaluated in a similar manner for P. pentosaceus 732.
