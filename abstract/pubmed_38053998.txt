Title: Human adipose tissue as a major reservoir of cytomegalovirus-reactive T cells. 
DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1303724 
Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common herpesvirus with a high prevalence worldwide. After the acute infection phase, CMV can remain latent in several tissues. CD8 T cells in the lungs and salivary glands mainly control its reactivation control. White adipose tissue (WAT) contains a significant population of memory T cells reactive to viral antigens, but CMV specificity has mainly been studied in mouse WAT. Therefore, we obtained blood, omental WAT (oWAT), subcutaneous WAT (sWAT), and liver samples from 11 obese donors to characterize the human WAT adaptive immune landscape from a phenotypic and immune receptor specificity perspective. We performed high-throughput sequencing of the T cell receptor (TCR) locus to analyze tissue and blood TCR repertoires of the 11 donors. The presence of TCRs specific to CMV epitopes was tested through ELISpot assays. Moreover, phenotypic characterization of T cells was carried out through flow cytometry. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that tissue TCR repertoires in oWAT, sWAT, and liver samples were less diverse and dominated by hyperexpanded clones when compared to blood samples. Additionally, we predicted the presence of TCRs specific to viral epitopes, particularly from CMV, which was confirmed by ELISpot assays. Remarkably, we found that oWAT has a higher proportion of CMV-reactive T cells than blood or sWAT. Finally, flow cytometry analyses indicated that most WAT-infiltrated lymphocytes were tissue-resident effector memory CD8 T cells. Overall, these findings postulate human oWAT as a major reservoir of CMV-specific T cells, presumably for latent viral reactivation control. This study enhances our understanding of the adaptive immune response in human WAT and highlights its potential role in antiviral defense.
