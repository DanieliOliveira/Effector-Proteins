Title: Carrier proteins boost expression of PR-39-derived peptide in Pichia pastoris. 
DOI: 10.1093/jambio/lxad297 
Abstract: Multidrug resistance presents difficulties in preventing and treating bacterial infections. Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) inhibit bacterial growth by affecting the intracellular targets rather than by permeabilizing the membrane. The aim of this study was to develop a yeast-based fusion carrier system using calmodulin (CaM) and xylanase (XynCDBFV) as two carriers to express the model PrAMP PR-39-derived peptide (PR-39-DP) in Pichia pastoris. Fusion protein secreted into the culture supernatant was purified in a one-step on-column digestion using human rhinovirus 3C protease, obtaining the target peptide PR-39-DP. The growth curves of Escherichia coli were monitored by recording the OD600 values of the bacteria. The antibacterial activity of PR-39-DP was evaluated in killing assays performed on E. coli. The yield of PR-39-DP was 1.0-1.2 mg l-1 in the CaM fusion carrier system, approximately three times that of the XynCDBFV fusion carrier system. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PR-39-DP was about 10.5 Î¼g ml-1. CaM and XynCDBFV provide increased stability and promote the expression and secretion of active PR-39-DP.
