Title: Metabolic network and proteomic expression perturbed by cyclosporine A to model microbe Escherichia coli. 
DOI: 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132975 
Abstract: Cyclosporine A (CsA) is a model drug that has caused great concern due to its widespread use and abuse in the environment. However, the potential harm of CsA to organisms also remains largely unknown, and this issue is exceptionally important for the health risk assessment of antibiotics. To address this concern, the crosstalk between CsA stress and cellular metabolism at the proteomic level in Escherichia coli was investigated and dissected in this study. The results showed that CsA inhibited E. coli growth in a time-dependent manner. CsA induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction in a dose- and time-dependent manner, leading to membrane depolarization followed by cell apoptosis. In addition, translation, the citric acid cycle, amino acid biosynthesis, glycolysis and responses to oxidative stress and heat were the central metabolic pathways induced by CsA stress. The upregulated proteins, including PotD, PotF and PotG, controlled cell growth. The downregulated proteins, including SspA, SspB, CstA and DpS, were regulators of self-feedback during the starvation process. And the up- and downregulated proteins, including AtpD, Adk, GroS, GroL and DnaK, controlled energy production. These results provide an important reference for the environmental health risk assessment of CsA.
