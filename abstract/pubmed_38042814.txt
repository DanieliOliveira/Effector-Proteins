Title: Targeted mutagenesis of the herpesvirus fusogen central helix captures transition states. 
DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-43011-w 
Abstract: Herpesviruses remain a burden for animal and human health, including the medically important varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Membrane fusion mediated by conserved core glycoproteins, the fusogen gB and the heterodimer gH-gL, enables herpesvirus cell entry. The ectodomain of gB orthologs has five domains and is proposed to transition from a prefusion to postfusion conformation but the functional relevance of the domains for this transition remains poorly defined. Here we describe structure-function studies of the VZV gB DIII central helix targeting residues 526EHV528. Critically, a H527P mutation captures gB in a prefusion conformation as determined by cryo-EM, a loss of membrane fusion in a virus free assay, and failure of recombinant VZV to spread in cell monolayers. Importantly, two predominant cryo-EM structures of gB[H527P] are identified by 3D classification and focused refinement, suggesting they represented gB conformations in transition. These studies reveal gB DIII as a critical element for herpesvirus gB fusion function.
