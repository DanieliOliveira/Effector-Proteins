Abstract: Proteases serve essential roles in numerous biological processes and signaling cascades by cleaving their substrates in a restricted manner or via degradation. It is important to determine which proteins are protease substrates and where their cleavage sites are located to characterize the impact of proteolysis on the molecular mechanisms of their substrates. N-terminomics is a branch of proteomics that enriches the N-terminal sequence of proteins. A proteome-wide collection of these sequences has been broadly applied to comprehend proteolytic cascades and for genome annotation. Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) is a combined N-terminomics and proteomics technique that has been applied for protein N-terminal characterization and quantification of natural and neo-N-termini of proteins using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). TAILS uses negative selection to enrich both original mature protein N-termini and neo-N-termini produced from proteolysis in a proteome labeled with isotopic tags. This approach has been applied to the investigation of protease function and substrate identification in cell culture systems, animal disease models, and, most recently, clinical samples such as blood and tumor tissues from cancer patients.
