Abstract: Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is widely recognized as a neuroprotective factor expressed in the retina and has shown therapeutic potential in several retinal diseases. Our study aimed to identify the neuroprotective fragment in PEDF and investigate its protective activity in retinas under ischemia-reperfusion (IR) condition. We synthesized a series of shorter synthetic peptides, 6-mer (Ser93-Gln98) and its d-form variant (6 dS) derived from the 44-mer (Val78-Thr121; a PEDF neurotrophic fragment), to determine their cytoprotective activity in IR injury, which was induced in rat retinas by injection of saline into the anterior chamber to increase the intraocular pressure (IOP) followed by reperfusion. We found the cytoprotective effect of 6-mer on glutamate-treated Neuro-2a cells and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-treated 661W cells were 2.6-fold and 1.5-fold higher than the 44-mer, respectively. The cytoprotective effect was blocked by a chemical inhibitor atglistatin and blocking antibody targeting PEDF receptor (PEDF-R). IR induced several impairments in retina, including cell apoptosis, activation of microglia/macroglia, degeneration of retinal capillaries, reduction in electroretinography (ERG) amplitudes, and retinal atrophy. Such IR injuries were ameliorated by treatment with 6-mer and 6 dS eye drops. Also, the neuroprotective activity of 6-mer and 6 dS in ischemic retinas were dramatically reversed by atglistatin preconditioning. Taken together, our data demonstrate smallest neuroprotective fragment of PEDF has potential to treat retinal degeneration-related diseases.
