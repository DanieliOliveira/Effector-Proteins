Title: Regulation of Hydrophobic Structures of Antibacterial Guanidinium-Based Amphiphilic Polymers for Subcutaneous Implant Applications. 
DOI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.3c00850 
Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide mimics have been used to kill bacteria and construct antibacterial materials. Precise design and construction of chemical structure are essential for easy access to highly effective antimicrobial peptide mimics. Herein, cationic guanidinium-based polymers (PGXs) with varying hydrophobic structures were synthesized to explore the structure and antibacterial activity relationship of antimicrobial peptide mimics and to construct antibacterial implants. The effect of the hydrophobic chemical structure, including carbon chain length and configuration, on the antimicrobial activities against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. The antibacterial activities of PGXs improved with increasing alkyl chain length, and PGXs with a straight-chain hydrophobic structure exhibited better bactericidal activities than those with cyclic alkane and aromatic hydrocarbon. Furthermore, PGXs grafted with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS-PGXs) showed a similar bactericidal change tendency of PGXs in solution. Additionally, the PDMS-PGXs showed potent antibiofilm performance in vitro, which can inhibit bacterial infection in vivo as subcutaneous implants. This study may propose a basis for the precise design and construction of antibacterial materials and provide a promising way of designing biomedical devices and implants with bacterial infection-combating activities.
