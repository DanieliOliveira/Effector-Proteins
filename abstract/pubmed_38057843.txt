Title: The nexus of natural killer cells and melanoma tumor microenvironment: crosstalk, chemotherapeutic potential, and innovative NK cell-based therapeutic strategies. 
DOI: 10.1186/s12935-023-03134-y 
Abstract: The metastasis of melanoma cells to regional lymph nodes and distant sites is an important contributor to cancer-related morbidity and mortality among patients with melanoma. This intricate process entails dynamic interactions involving tumor cells, cellular constituents, and non-cellular elements within the microenvironment. Moreover, both microenvironmental and systemic factors regulate the metastatic progression. Central to immunosurveillance for tumor cells are natural killer (NK) cells, prominent effectors of the innate immune system with potent antitumor and antimetastatic capabilities. Recognizing their pivotal role, contemporary immunotherapeutic strategies are actively integrating NK cells to combat metastatic tumors. Thus, a meticulous exploration of the interplay between metastatic melanoma and NK cells along the metastatic cascade is important. Given the critical involvement of NK cells within the melanoma tumor microenvironment, this comprehensive review illuminates the intricate relationship between components of the melanoma tumor microenvironment and NK cells, delineating their multifaceted roles. By shedding light on these critical aspects, this review advocates for a deeper understanding of NK cell dynamics within the melanoma context, driving forward transformative strategies to combat this cancer.
