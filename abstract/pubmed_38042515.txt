Title: URP20 improves corneal injury caused by alkali burns combined with pathogenic bacterial infection in rats. 
DOI: 10.1016/j.exer.2023.109739 
Abstract: Corneal alkali burns often occur in industrial production and daily life, combined with infection, and may cause severe eye disease. Oxidative stress and neovascularization (NV) are important factors leading to a poor prognosis. URP20 is an antimicrobial peptide that has been proven to treat bacterial keratitis in rats through antibacterial and anti-NV effects. Therefore, in this study, the protective effect and influence mechanism of URP20 were explored in a rat model of alkali burn together with pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) infection. In addition, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) were selected to verify the effects of URP20 on vascularization and oxidative stress. The results showed that URP20 treatment could protect corneal tissue, reduce corneal turbidity, and reduce the NV pathological score. Furthermore, URP20 significantly inhibited the expression of the vascularization marker proteins VEGFR2 and CD31. URP20 also reduced the migration ability of HUVECs. In terms of oxidative stress, URP20 significantly upregulated SOD and GSH contents in corneal tissue and HCECs (treated with 200 μM H2O2) and promoted the expression of the antioxidant protein Nrf2/HO-1. At the same time, MDA and ROS levels were also inhibited. In conclusion, URP20 could improve corneal injury combined with bacterial infection in rats caused by alkali burns through antibacterial, anti-NV, and antioxidant activities.
