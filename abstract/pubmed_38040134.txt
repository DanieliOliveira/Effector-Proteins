Abstract: Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are the first line of immune defense in invertebrates against pathogen infection; they recognize pathogens and transmit signals to downstream immune pathways. Among these, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are an important family in invertebrates that generally comprise of complicated isoforms. A comprehensive understanding of PGRPs in evolutionarily and economically important marine invertebrates, such as the sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, is crucial. Previous studies have identified two PGRPs in sea cucumber, AjPGRP-S and AjPGRP-S1, and another novel short-type PGRP, AjPGRP-S3, was additionally identified here. The full-length cDNA sequence of AjPGRP-S3 was obtained here by PCR-RACE, followed by which showed its gene expression analyses by in situ hybridization that showed it to be relatively highly expressed in coelomocytes and tube feet. Based on an analysis of the recombinant protein, rAjPGRP-S3, a board-spectrum pathogen recognition ability was noted that covered diverse Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, and fungi. Moreover, according to the results of yeast two-hybridization, it was suggested that rAJPGRP-S3 interacted with multiple immune-related factors, including proteins involved in the complement system, extracellular matrix, vesicle trafficking, and antioxidant system. These findings prove the important functions of AjPGRP-S3 in the transduction of pathogen signals to downstream immune effectors and help explore the functional differences in the AjPGRP isoforms.
