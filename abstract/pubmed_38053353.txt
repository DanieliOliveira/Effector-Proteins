Abstract: Binding appropriate cellular receptors is a crucial step of a lifecycle for any virus. Structure of receptor-binding domain for a viral surface protein has to be determined before the start of future drug design projects. Investigation of pH-induced changes in the secondary structure for a capsid peptide with loss of function mutation can shed some light on the mechanism of entrance. Spectroscopic methods were accompanied by electrophoresis, ultrafiltration, and computational biochemistry. In this study, we showed that a peptide from the receptor-binding domain of Parvovirus B19 VP1 capsid (residues 13-31) is beta-structural at pH=7.4 in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, but alpha- helical at pH=5.0, according to the circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy results. Results of infra- red (IR) spectroscopy showed that the same peptide exists in both alpha-helical and beta-structural conformations in partial dehydration conditions both at pH=7.4 and pH=5.0. In contrast, the peptide with Y20W mutation, which is known to block the internalization of the virus, forms mostly alpha-helical conformation in partial dehydration conditions at pH=7.4. According to our hypothesis, an intermolecular antiparallel beta structure formed by the wild-type peptide in its tetramers at pH=7.4 is the prototype of the similar intermolecular antiparallel beta structure formed by the corresponding part of Parvovirus B19 receptor-binding domain with its cellular receptor (AXL). Loss of function Y20W substitution in VP1 capsid protein prevents the shift into the beta-structural state by way of alpha helix stabilization and the decrease of its ability to turn into the disordered state.
