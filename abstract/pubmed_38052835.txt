Abstract: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens has become a major global health concern. To address this challenge, innovative strategies such as bacteriophage therapy must be optimised. Genomic characterisation is a crucial step in identifying suitable phage candidates for combating AMR pathogens. The aim of this study was to characterise seven phages that infect the Escherichia coli O177 strain using a whole genome sequencing. The analysis of genome sequences revealed that these phages had linear dsDNA, with genome sizes spanning from 136, 483 to 166,791Â bp and GC content varying from 35.39 to 43.63%. Taxonomically, the phages were classified under three different subfamilies (Stephanstirmvirinae, Tevenvirinae, and Vequintavirinae) and three genera (Phapecoctavirus, Tequatrovirus, and Vequintavirus) within the class Caudoviricetes. In silico PhageAI analysis predicted that all the phages were virulent, with confidence levels between 96.07 and 97.26%. The phage genomes contained between 66 and 82 ORFs, which encode hypothetical and putative functional proteins. In addition, the phage genomes contained core genes associated with molecular processes such as DNA replication, transcription modulation, nucleotide metabolism, phage structure (capsid and tail), and lysis. None of the genomes carried genes associated with undesirable traits such as integrase, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and toxins. The study revealed high genome and proteome homology among E. coli O177 phages and other known Escherichia phages. The results suggest that the seven phages are new members of the genera Phapecoctavirus, Tequatrovirus, and Vequintavirus under the subfamilies Stephanstirmvirinae, Tevenvirinae, and Vequintavirinae, respectively.
