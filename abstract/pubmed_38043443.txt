Title: Combating bacterial infections with host defense peptides: Shifting focus from bacteria to host immunity. 
DOI: 10.1016/j.drup.2023.101030 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections necessitates the exploration of novel paradigms for anti-infective therapy. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also known as host defense peptides (HDPs), have garnered extensive recognition as immunomodulatory molecules that leverage natural host mechanisms to enhance therapeutic benefits. The unique immune mechanism exhibited by certain HDPs exhibited by certain HDPs, which that involves their self-assembly into supramolecular nanonets capable of inducing bacterial agglutination and entrapping is significantly important bacteria. This process effectively prevents microbial invasion and subsequent dissemination and significantly mitigates selective pressure for the evolution of microbial resistance, highlighting the potential of HDP-based antimicrobial therapy. Recent advancements in this field have focused on developing bio-responsive materials in the form of supramolecular nanonets. A comprehensive overview of the immunomodulatory and bacteria-agglutinating activities of HDPs, along with a discussion on optimization strategies for synthetic derivatives, is presented in this article. These optimized derivatives exhibit improved biological properties and therapeutic potential, making them suitable for future clinical applications as effective anti-infective therapeutics.
