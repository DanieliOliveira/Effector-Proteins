Title: Systemic Administration with Bacteria-Inspired Nanosystems for Targeted Oncolytic Therapy and Antitumor Immunomodulation. 
DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.3c10302 
Abstract: Malignant tumors represent a formidable global health challenge, compelling the pursuit of innovative treatment modalities. Oncolytic therapy has emerged as a promising frontier in antitumor strategies. However, both natural agents (such as oncolytic bacteria or viruses) and synthetic oncolytic peptides confront formidable obstacles in clinical trials, which include the delicate equilibrium between safety and efficacy, the imperative for systemic administration with targeted therapy, and the need to counteract oncolysis-induced immunosuppression. To overcome these dilemmas, we have developed biomimetic nanoengineering to create oncolytic bacteria-inspired nanosystems (OBNs), spanning from hierarchical structural biomimicry to advanced bioactive biomimicry. Our OBNs harbor inherent oncolytic potential, including functionalized oligosaccharides mimicking bacterial cell walls for optimal blood circulation and tumor targeting, tumor acidity-switchable decoration for tumor-specific oncolysis, stereospecific tryptophan-rich peptides for robust oncolytic activity, encapsulated tumor immunomodulators for enhanced immunotherapy, and innate multimodal imaging potential for biological tracing. This work elucidates the efficacy and mechanisms of OBNs, encompassing primary tumor suppression, metastasis prevention, and recurrence inhibition. Systemic administration of d-chiral OBNs has demonstrated superior oncolytic efficacy, surpassing intratumoral injections of clinical-grade oncolytic peptides. This work heralds an era in biomimetic engineering on oncolytic agents, promising the revolutionization of contemporary oncolytic therapy paradigms for clinical translation.
