Title: Antifungal properties of cathelicidin LL-37: current knowledge and future research directions. 
DOI: 10.1007/s11274-023-03852-5 
Abstract: The threat of fungal diseases is substantially underestimated worldwide, but they have serious consequences for humans, animals, and plants. Given the limited number of existing antifungal drugs together with the emergence of drug-resistant strains, many researchers have actively sought alternatives or adjuvants to antimycotics. The best way to tackle these issues is to unearth potential antifungal agents with new modes of action. Antimicrobial peptides are being hailed as a promising source of novel antimicrobials since they exhibit rapid and broad-spectrum microbicidal activities with a reduced likelihood of developing drug resistance. Recent years have witnessed an explosion in knowledge on microbicidal activity of LL-37, the sole human cathelicidin. Herein, we provide a summary of the current understanding about antifungal properties of LL-37, with particular emphasis on its molecular mechanisms. We further illustrate fruitful areas for future research. LL-37 is able to inhibit the growth of clinically and agronomically relevant fungi including Aspergillus, Candida, Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Malassezia, Pythium, and Trichophyton. Destruction of the cell wall integrity, membrane permeabilization, induction of oxidative stress, disruption of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, formation of autophagy-like structures, alterations in expression of numerous fungal genes, and inhibition of cell cycle progression are the key mechanisms underlying antifungal effects of LL-37. Burgeoning evidence also suggests that LL-37 may act as a potential anti-virulence peptide. It is hoped that this review will not only motivate researchers to conduct more detailed studies in this field, but also inspire further innovations in the design of LL-37-based drugs for the treatment of fungal infections.
