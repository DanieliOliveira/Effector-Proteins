Title: Phylogenetic analyses of Chilomastix and Retortamonas species using in vitro excysted flagellates. 
DOI: 10.1590/S1984-29612023070 
Abstract: In vitro excystation of cysts of microscopically identified Chilomastix mesnili and Retortamonas sp. isolated from Japanese macaques and Retortamonas sp. isolated from small Indian mongooses could be induced using an established protocol for Giardia intestinalis and subsequently by culturing with H2S-rich Robinson's medium supplemented with Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. Excystation usually began 2 h after incubation in Robinson's medium. DNA was isolated from excysted flagellates after 4 h of incubation or from cultured excysted flagellates. Phylogenetic analysis based on their 18S rRNA genes revealed that two isolates of C. mesnili from Japanese macaques belonged to the same cluster as a C. mesnili isolate from humans, whereas a mammalian Retortamonas sp. isolate from a small Indian mongoose belonged to the same cluster as that of an amphibian Retortamonas spp. isolate from a 'poison arrow frog' [sequence identity to AF439347 (94.9%)]. These results suggest that the sequence homology of the 18S rRNA gene of the two C. mesnili isolates from Japanese macaques was similar to that of humans, in addition to the morphological similarity, and Retortamonas sp. infection of the amphibian type in the small Indian mongoose highlighted the possibility of the effect of host feeding habitats.
