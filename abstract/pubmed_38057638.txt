Title: From microbes to molecules: a review of microbial-driven antioxidant peptide generation. 
DOI: 10.1007/s11274-023-03826-7 
Abstract: Oxidative stress, arising from excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) or insufficient antioxidant defenses, can damage cellular components, such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, resulting in cellular dysfunction. The relationship between oxidative stress and various health disorders has prompted investigations into potent antioxidants that counteract ROS's detrimental impacts. In this context, antioxidant peptides, composed of two to twenty amino acids, have emerged as a unique group of antioxidants and have found applications in food, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals. Antioxidant peptides are sourced from natural ingredients, mainly proteins derived from foods like milk, eggs, meat, fish, and plants. These peptides can be freed from their precursor proteins through enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, or gastrointestinal digestion. Previously published studies focused on the origin and production methods of antioxidant peptides, describing their structure-activity relationship and the mechanisms of food-derived antioxidant peptides. Yet, the role of microorganisms hasn't been sufficiently explored, even though the production of antioxidant peptides frequently employs a variety of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and yeasts, which are recognized for producing specific proteases. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of microorganisms and their proteases participating in enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation to produce antioxidant peptides. This review also covers endogenous peptides originating from microorganisms. The information obtained from this review might guide the discovery of novel organisms adept at generating antioxidant peptides.
